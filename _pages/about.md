# üöÄ About me
I am currently a third-year master's student at Tsinghua University advised by Prof.[Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Previously, I receive my bachelor‚Äôs degree from Xidian University in 2022.

My research interests lie in multimodal large language model (MLLM), computer vision (CV). I have interned at Baidu NLP Group (ERNIE), Tencent Youtu Lab, DJI Automotive Perception Group, etc.

# üíª Industrial Experience
- **Baidu ERNIE, 2024.05 - Now, Shenzhen.** \
  *Topic*: Multimodal Large Language Model Pre-training \
  *Job Description*: I develop Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for ERNIE Bot. Specifically, I focus on *video MLLM*, involving video, image, audio, and language modalities.
- **Tencent Youtu, 2024.03 - 2024.05, Shenzhen.** \
  *Topic*: Multimodal Large Language Model Pre-training \
  *Job Description*: I work on Multimodal Large Language Model based on *discrete coding*.
- **DJI Automotive, 2023.10 - 2024.02, Shenzhen.** \
  *Topic*: Multimodal Image-Text Pre-training \
  *Job Description*: I develop a image-text retrieval system for DJI Automotive. Specifically, I enhance the existing multimodal model's performance on traffic scene using image-text pre-traing. I also leverage LLM (Large Language Model) and Diffusion Model to generate synthetic data to further enhance the model's performance.
- **Tencent, 2023.03 - 2023.07, Shenzhen.** \
  *Topic*: Text to Image Generation (AIGC) \
  *Job Description*: I employed various techniques to improve the performance of the AIGC model, such as image aesthetics assessment and human keypoint detection.
